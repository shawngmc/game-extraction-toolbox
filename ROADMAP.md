## Owned / Under Investigation
- Capcom Arcade Stadium 1
  Current versions have an odd archive format (unlike the CAS1_Old ZIP version).
  PLACEHOLDER ADDED. See #18.
- Capcom Arcade Stadium 2
  Current versions have an odd archive format (unlike the CAS1_Old ZIP version).
  PLACEHOLDER ADDED. See #18.
- Mega Man Zero / ZX Collection
- Mega Man X Legacy Collection 2
- Mega Man Legacy Collection 
- Arcade Collection Anniversary Classics
  Mostly working, but 2 titles remain...
- Psiyko Shooter Collector's Bundle https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/18805/PSIKYO_SHOOTER_Collectors_Bundle/
- PSP: EA Replay
  \PSP_GAME\USRDIR\data\roms.viv is an EA BIG4 archive that can be extracted via QuickBMS
  It has sensible ROM filenames, but the files are too small and not in an expected format.
  They don't appear to have REFPACK, zlib or gzip headers, nor use RAW DEFLATE.
- The King of Fighters 97 Global Match
  Possibly KOF 97? http://adb.arcadeitalia.net/dettaglio_mame.php?game_name=kof97
  In data/rom/:
  - exact matches
    m1.bin is cslot1:audiocpu 232-m1.m1
    s1.bin and s2.bin are identical, and are cslot1:fixed 232-s1.s1
    sp_4j.bin is japan-mv1b:mainbios japan-j3.bin
    p1.bin is cslot1:maincpu roms - concatenated 232-p1.p1 and 232-p2.sp2
    v1.bin is cslot1:ymsnd:adpcma - concatenated 232-v1.v1, 232-v2.v2, 232-v3.v3
  - suspected
    c1.bin appears to be the cslot1:sprite roms, interleaved as expected
  - only in kof97gm
    sp_4s.bin is likely a mainbios, but not a known one
  - not in kof97gm
    spritegen:zoomy	000-lo.lo
    fixedbios sfix.sfix
    audiobios sm1.sm1
  - Vasara Collection
    Partial roms exist in VasaraCollection_Data/StreamingData/VSR1.dat and VSR2.dat, but there's some missing, and the other files are UnityFS
    VSR1.dat
    0x00000000	0x001FFFFF	2MB	data.u34
    0x00200000	0x002FFFFF	1MB	NULL
    0x00300000	0x003FFFFF	1MB	deinterleave(1b) -> prg-l.u30, prg-h.u31
    0x00400000	0x01FFFFFF	16MB	???
    0x02000000	0x023FFFFF	4MB	NULL
    Missing 36 MB of contents with 16MB of unidentified stuff?
  - Retro SNES Collection Vol. 1 (Jim Power, Legend, Iron Commando, Dorke and Ymp)
  - S-Tribute (Metal Black S-Tribute, Puzzle Bobble 2x/3 and Bust-a-Move 2/3 S-Tribute)
    - These appear to have a bin-cue file pair for each title
    - However, these are not mountable - are they encrypted?

## Incomplete ROMs (may add partial extraction later)

  Audio ROMs were replaced with a different audio solution.

  Maincpu and Gfx ROMs are there, but audio is completely reworked.

### .SR Releases
The SR archives can be extracted via QuickBMS script: https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=13718
However, these seem to always use rebuilt audio, and some of the games have been rebuilt as native ELF executables.
